# Glycolysis simulations

The file `Glycolysis_simulations.nb` contains all the code used to produce the simulation figures in the paper. 

We use the model by [Smallbone et al](https://febs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1016/j.febslet.2013.06.043) (`MODEL1303260018.xml`) downloaded from the [biomodels](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels-main/MODEL1303260018) database on 11/1/2019.

To run this notebook you'll need MASS-toolbox, which can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/opencobra/MASS-Toolbox/releases). We used version 1.1.9.

`Glycolysis_simulations.cdf` is a CDF version of the original Mathematica notebook, which allows the user to interact with it and only requires [Wolfram's free CDF player](https://www.wolfram.com/cdf-player/).
